/**
 * Compile shim for CI only — NOT an API reference.
 *
 * `cc` is the Cocos Creator engine runtime module, injected by the Creator
 * editor/build pipeline at build and preview time. It is not an npm package
 * and this extension does not (and cannot) depend on it via package.json,
 * so a bare `tsc` invocation — as CI's "Type-check runtime assets" step
 * runs, outside the Creator editor — cannot resolve it without a stand-in
 * declaration like this one.
 *
 * Cocos Creator's own bundled engine typings remain the source of truth for
 * the real `cc` module. This file declares only the members `assets/`
 * actually imports from `cc` / `cc/env`, each typed to match the real
 * engine API just closely enough to compile these specific call sites. It
 * does not attempt to model `cc` completely, must never be widened "to look
 * complete", and must not be used as documentation of the engine API.
